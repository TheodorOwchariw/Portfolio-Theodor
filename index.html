        <h1>Hi, I'm Theodor Owchariw</h1>
        <p>
          Culturally, I’m proud of my Puerto Rican and Ukrainian roots. I grew up in New Jersey and moved to South Florida during high school. 
          <br><br>
          I graduated from Florida State University with a Bachelor of Science in Computer Engineering, where I developed a strong foundation in hardware design, programming, and systems engineering. 
          I've recently graduated with my Master’s degree in Artificial Intelligence at Florida Atlantic University. I have also recently completed a traineeship in the National Science Foundation’s NRT-HDR program: <i>A Graduate Traineeship in Data Science Technologies and Applications</i>, where I collaborated on cutting-edge AI & data science research and interdisciplinary innovation.
          <br><br>
          My skill set includes Python, PyTorch, TensorFlow, R, and C++, with experience in deep learning, computer vision, data science, and machine learning. 
          <br>
          I enjoy blending creativity with technology and take pride in building intelligent systems that solve meaningful problems and have real-world impact.
          <br>
          Outside of academics, I’m passionate about listening to music, photography, reading, and playing the guitar in my free time.

      <h1>Relevant Projects</h1>
        <b>Counting Underwater Manatee Aggregations using Deep Learning (Master’s Thesis ongoing):</b> Developed a semi-supervised computer vision pipeline using YOLO-based object detection and image segmentation to identify and track manatees in underwater survey imagery. Implemented pseudo-labeling and model with evaluation via MAE and MASE to improve performance on limited labeled data.
        <br><br><b>LexEmetica: AI Legal Brief Generator (2025):</b> Created a generative AI tool to automatically produce structured case briefs for law students and professionals. The system uses citation validation, page-aware summarization, and supports both "Student Mode" and "Professional Mode" using fully open-source LLM components.
        <br><br><b>Forecasting Shark Populations Using LSTM Neural Networks (2024):</b> Applied one-hot encoding for categorical variables and implemented cyclical feature engineering to capture temporal patterns. Used custom normalization strategies and bucketed classification to forecast shark population trends based on species, GPS coordinates, and year.      
        <br><br><b>Deep Learning for Identification of Toxic Plant Species (2024):</b> Designed a plant classification system using deep learning (TensorFlow) and visual leaf characteristics to identify and label toxic vs. non-toxic species, with an emphasis on real-world application in Florida’s native environment. Focused on binary classification using limited training images per class.
